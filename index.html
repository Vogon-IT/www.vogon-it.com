  <div class="row">
    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Vogon-IT Oy develops and manufactures computer controlled photography systems customized based on customer needs. Our goal is to produce a photography device with a connected information storage platform to combine digital photography with time and location information. We also provide traditional webcam solutions and remote sensing consultation.</p>

  <h2>Our Background</h2>
  <p>The Vogon-IT builds on the heritage of karhukamera project, which has been succesfully
   collecting time-lapse images since 2005. The expertise of our team ranges from traditional IT-support to hard core science in remote sensing.</p><p>Time-lapse is predicted to become a wide-range observation tool for everything from a weather camera to a tool for industrial observation and scientific research.</p>

    </a>
    <p>Ulvila Observatory time-lapse camera has photographed the Pori city horizon since 2005 and it has been taken over 3 million photography. The camera is sealed in a weatherproof box made of stainless steel and the temperature in the box is kept stable with a resistor element that is controlled by a thermostat.</p>

    <p>R!MU (Really! Moving Unit) is unit that can be easily installed on different platforms.  R!MU supported a scientific field campaign near north pole on board <a href="http://arctic.taraexpeditions.org/" target="_blank">arctic schooner Tara</a> in 2007 and its data was used in study: "<a href="http://www.karhukamera.com/project/docs/PS_Pro_Gradu.pdf" target="_blank">Melt pond coverage and temporal evolution at driftin station Tara during summer 2007</a>".</p>

    <p>The prototype of our ship camera system was installed on RV Lance for a cruise in the Fram Strait during August and September 2007. The simple system provided photos from more than 90% of the cruise, including several days of photos from the marginal ice zone of Greenland.</p>

    <p>The helicopter camera is built for aircraft installation. The casing includes mounts that fit the undercarriage of a Jet Ranger helicopter. The unit was used in SNORTEX campaign in northern Finland. FMI used the images to succesfully derive the Leaf Area Index of boreal forest.
